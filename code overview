Comprehensive Explanation of the Editorial AI Assistant Code

I'll walk through the main components of your code, explaining both the backend and frontend functionality.

Overview

The Editorial AI Assistant is a Streamlit web application that helps users standardize and correct text in Word documents according to specific style guidelines. It uses Claude AI (via AWS Bedrock) to perform grammar corrections and pattern replacements.
Backend Components
1. Configuration Management
# Config handling (imported from config.py)
from config import get_llm_config, get_model_id, get_anthropic_version, get_max_tokens, get_service_name, get_region_name
These functions read configuration settings from a config.ini file, providing parameters for connecting to AWS Bedrock and configuring the AI model.
2. AWS Integration
# AWS Bedrock client setup
client = boto3.client(
    service_name=get_service_name(),
    region_name=get_region_name()
)
cred = client._get_credentials()
config_list = [get_llm_config()]
config_list[0].update({
    "aws_access_key": cred.access_key,
    "aws_secret_key": cred.secret_key,
    "aws_session_token": cred.token,
})
This code sets up the AWS Bedrock client with proper credentials to connect to Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
3. AI Interaction
def invoke_claude_3_with_text(system_prompt, prompt='You are an AI assistant'):
    # Function to send requests to Claude AI via AWS Bedrock
This function handles the interaction with Claude AI, sending prompts and receiving responses. It formats the request with system and user messages and handles response parsing.
4. Pattern Definitions
# Define regex patterns for dynamic date/year matching
YEAR_PATTERN = r'(20\d{2}|\d{2})'
MONTH_NAMES = r'(?:January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December|Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec)'
The code defines regex patterns for identifying various text formats like dates, quarters, and fiscal years.
5. Country Prefixing
# List of countries to prefix with "the"
COUNTRIES_TO_PREFIX = [
    "UK", "US", "Middle East", "Philippines", "Netherlands", "Czech Republic", "United Arab Emirates", "UAE"
]
This list specifies countries that should be prefixed with "the" in proper English.
6. Replacement Rules Dictionary
REPLACEMENT_RULES = {
    "Year-over-Year": {
        "examples": "yoy, YoY, y/y, Y/Y, y/ y, y o y, YOY, year-on-year, year on year",
        "target_options": ["YoY", "y/y", "year-on-year"],
        "default_target":"y/y"
    },
    # ... many more rules
}
This extensive dictionary defines all the replacement patterns and their target formats, organized by categories like time comparisons, dates, currencies, etc.
7. Text Processing Functions
Key text processing functions include:
def extract_text_from_docx(file_path):
    # Extract text from DOCX files
def build_llm_prompt_for_corrections(text, patterns_to_replacements):
    # Build prompts for the AI model
def llm_grammar_and_pattern_correction(text, patterns_to_replacements):
    # Apply AI-based corrections
def format_replacement(matched_text, replacement_template):
    # Format dynamic replacements with actual values
def apply_regex_replacements(text, patterns_to_replacements, dynamic_rules, selected_rules, rule_targets):
    # Apply regex-based replacements
def convert_numbers_to_words(text):
    # Convert numeric digits to words where appropriate
These functions handle different aspects of text processing, from extraction to formatting and correction.
8. Document Processing
def process_paragraph(paragraph, patterns_to_replacements, dynamic_rules, selected_rules, rule_targets, use_llm=True):
    # Process individual paragraphs
def create_patterns_dict(selected_rules, rule_targets):
    # Create patterns dictionary from selected rules
def create_dynamic_rules_dict(selected_rules):
    # Create dynamic rules dictionary
def remove_evaluation_warning(input_file, output_file):
    # Remove Spire.Doc evaluation warnings
def compare_documents(original_path, corrected_path, output_path, custom_correction_name=""):
    # Create tracked changes document
These functions manage document processing, handling paragraphs, creating rule dictionaries, and comparing documents to show changes.
9. Main Processing Function
def process_docx_with_llm(uploaded_file, selected_rules, rule_targets, use_grammar_correction=True, use_country_prefixing=True, custom_correction_name="", progress_callback=None):
    # Main function to process DOCX files
This is the main function that orchestrates the document processing workflow, from file upload to creating the final document with tracked changes.
Processing Flow (Backend)
1. The user uploads a document and selects style rules
2. The system creates temporary files to work with
3. It processes each paragraph and table cell using:
‚Ä¢ AI-based grammar correction (if enabled)
‚Ä¢ Pattern replacement using regex
‚Ä¢ Number-to-word conversion
‚Ä¢ Number formatting
4. It compares the original and corrected documents, creating a version with tracked changes
5. It returns the processed document for download
Frontend Components (in the separate code)
The frontend code uses Streamlit to create a user-friendly web interface with these key components:
1. Page Configuration
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Editorial AI Assistant",
    page_icon="üìù",
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="expanded"
)
Sets up the overall page structure and appearance.
2. Custom CSS
def local_css():
    st.markdown("""
    <style>
    .main-header {
        font-size: 2.5rem;
        # ... more CSS styles
    }
    </style>
    """, unsafe_allow_html=True)
Defines custom styling for a more polished user interface.
3. Header Display
def display_header():
    st.markdown('<h1 class="main-header">Editorial AI Assistant</h1>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
    # ... additional header content
Creates the application header with information about the tool.
4. Style Format Management
def display_style_manager(style_formats):
    # Function to manage saved style formats
Allows users to save, load, and manage style format presets.
5. Rule Selection Interface
def display_rule_selection():
    # Display UI for selecting style rules
Creates the interface for users to select which style rules to apply.
6. Target Format Selection
def display_target_selection(selected_rules):
    # Interface for choosing target formats
Lets users choose the specific output format for each selected rule.
7. Document Processing Interface
def display_document_processor(style_formats, selected_format):
    # Main document processing interface
Handles file uploads, processing options, and document processing.
User Flow (Frontend)
1. User visits the app and sees the header with tool information
2. They can select a saved style format or create a custom one by:
‚Ä¢ Selecting specific rules to apply
‚Ä¢ Choosing target formats for each rule
3. They upload a document for processing
4. They can set additional options like:
‚Ä¢ Custom name for tracked changes
‚Ä¢ Grammar correction toggle
‚Ä¢ Country prefixing toggle
5. After clicking "Process Document", they see:
‚Ä¢ A progress bar during processing
‚Ä¢ Success message when complete
‚Ä¢ Download button for the processed document
‚Ä¢ Processing summary with stats
Integration Points
‚Ä¢ The frontend calls process_docx_with_llm() from the backend when the user clicks "Process Document"
‚Ä¢ The backend uses AWS credentials to access Claude AI via Bedrock
‚Ä¢ The result is a downloadable document with tracked changes showing all corrections
Error Handling
The code includes extensive error handling throughout:
‚Ä¢ Try-except blocks around AWS API calls
‚Ä¢ Error handling for document loading and saving
‚Ä¢ Progress updates during processing
‚Ä¢ User-friendly error messages displayed in the Streamlit interface
Style Sheet Format
In your implementation, the style formatting can be saved and loaded. Style formats contain:
6. A list of selected rules to apply
7. The target format for each rule
For example, a style format might specify that:
‚Ä¢ "Year-over-Year" should be formatted as "y/y"
‚Ä¢ Quarters should be formatted as "1Q23" (not "Q1 2023")
‚Ä¢ Currency should be displayed as "USD" (not "$")
Advanced Features
1. Grammar Correction
The AI doesn't just replace patterns - it also corrects grammar issues in the text using Claude's language capabilities.
if use_llm:
    processed_text = llm_grammar_and_pattern_correction(text, patterns_to_replacements)
2. Number to Word Conversion
The system intelligently converts numbers to words where appropriate:
final_text = convert_numbers_to_words(final_text)
For example, "1 person" becomes "one person", but numbers in dates, percentages or measurements remain as digits.
3. Country Prefixing
The system adds "the" before countries that require it grammatically:
# Always apply country prefixing with "the" - using a safer approach
words = modified_text.split()
for i in range(len(words)):
    # Check if the current word matches a country
    for country in COUNTRIES_TO_PREFIX:
        if words[i].lower() == country.lower() or words[i].lower() == country.lower() + ',' or words[i].lower() == country.lower() + '.':
            # Check if the previous word is not "the"
            if i == 0 or words[i-1].lower() != "the":
                # Handle punctuation
                if words[i][-1] in [',', '.', ':', ';', '?', '!']:
                    punctuation = words[i][-1]
                    words[i] = "the " + country + punctuation
                else:
                    words[i] = "the " + country
4. Tracked Changes
One of the most valuable features is that all changes are tracked, allowing users to see and accept/reject modifications:
def compare_documents(original_path, corrected_path, output_path, custom_correction_name=""):
    # ...
    original_doc.TrackChanges = True
    # ...
    original_doc.Compare(corrected_doc, correction_name)
Performance Considerations
The code uses several techniques to optimize performance:
8. Temporary Files: Using tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() for secure, efficient file handling
9. Memory Management: Using BytesIO for in-memory document processing
10. Process Tracking: Counting items and providing progress updates
11. Selective Processing: Only processing non-empty paragraphs
12. Avoiding Duplicate Processing: Tracking processed ranges to prevent overlapping replacements
